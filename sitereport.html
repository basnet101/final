			<h2><u>Experience while developing the website:</u></h2>
			<p>What we learned in the module:</p>
			<p>I came to this institution knowing very little about HTML and CSS. However, I've learned a lot about two main languages that are used as building blocks in web development over this first semester. I believe that the classes to which I had devoted myself were beneficial to me as a student.<br>Learning through this online platform has also been difficult during the pandemic. It's much more difficult to communicate via video, photographs, and other mediums than it is in physical classes. I gradually learned more about it through intensive research and rectifying enough mistakes, but it still feels like there are so many things I could learn. Web developers and designers have gained respect because of using and knowing HTML and CSS. I learned how to develop a functioning navigation bar, apply shadow boxes, use padding and color efficiently, input images and format their size and shape, and use a hamburger menu to display the menu bar while building this project.I faced many problems such as syntex errors and logical errors while writting the code of HTML and CSS. Sometimes I made error while closing the tags properly, incorrectly naming the images files while linking them and so on.  am grateful to all of my teachers and friends that assisted me with this journey.<br> 
			To summarize, I found this course to be beneficial. I'm delighted I took this course because it has helped me improve my development skills. I learned about a variety of things that I was previously unaware of.
